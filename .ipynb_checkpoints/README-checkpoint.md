# Project Summary
In this project, you will complete the following steps:

**Step 1**: Train and deploy a model on Sagemaker, using the most appropriate instances. Set up multi-instance training in your Sagemaker notebook.
**Step 2**: Adjust your Sagemaker notebooks to perform training and deployment on EC2.
**Step 3**: Set up a Lambda function for your deployed model. Set up auto-scaling for your deployed endpoint as well as concurrency for your Lambda function.
**Step 4**: Ensure that the security on your ML pipeline is set up properly.
